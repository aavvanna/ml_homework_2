PROMPTS:
1) I sent you my app.js.
It's already working: it selects a random review and determines the sentiment in the browser.
Using this code, add the missing parts to send logs to a Google Sheet.
The following columns need to be logged: Timestamp, Review, Sentiment, Confidence, Meta
It's important that the method is used and that I avoid any errors.
Don't rewrite the entire file. Just add what's missing.

2) I have an empty Google Sheet.
Based on the previous edits to app.js, write a simple Google Apps Script that will accept such a request, read the data, and add a row to the table.
The script should work fine with the method used to avoid CORS.
